# SemiTree---analysis-of-phylogenetic-trees
SemiTree - Python Biopython application for mass analysis of phylogenetic trees with corresponding fasta sequences and given traits. Main goals:  auto-locate orthologous clades within a phylogenetic protein tree, calculate trait conservation per clade given consensus and to run comparative analysis between clades (e.g. rate change between clades)
